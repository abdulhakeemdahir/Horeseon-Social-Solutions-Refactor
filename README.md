# Horiseon-Social-Solutions-Refactor

## Developer Profile

My name is Abdulhakeem Dahir and I am an aspiring Software Developer. I have always had an interest in programming, but was too afraid to pursue a career as I felt it was too daunting of task. Even though we are living in difficult times in 2020, I decided to take the plunge. I hope that my work will show my development as a Developer and my growth in this field. This is my first project, so here goes.

## Client Request

Our client, "Horiseon Social Solutions" requested a code refactor for their website. They wanted a more semantic, logical and consolidated code base. Most importantly though, they wanted accessibility for impaired-users. The following is the direct 'User Story' and the 'Acceptance Criteria' for the project:

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Changes

The follwing are all of the changes that I have made for the code refactor:

### HTML

- Added a new website Title
